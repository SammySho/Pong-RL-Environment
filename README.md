# Pong-RL-Environment
An version of Pong created to be used with the OpenAI Gym API. There is single-agent setup and a multi-agent setup, with the option for cooperative or competitive reward schems.


There are simple and advanced mechanics in this project. The simple mechanics cause the ball to reflect off the paddle in the same way as refracting light, where the angle of incidence is = the angle of reflection. The advanced mechanics allow for the angle and speed of a return to be increased or reduced dependent on the location of contact of the ball on the paddle.
